    <h1>Condition 1</h1>

    <hr>

    <p> You decided to pursue some works of calligraphy and skip others based on the combination of value and difficulty.
        You will collect 9 of their skipped works of calligraphy.
        You are going to see the same room and work of calligraphy as that earlier participant. This means you will see the same work of calligraphy and
        experience the same difficulty as they did. However, you will not see the value of the work of calligraphy.
        Your goal is to try to accurately estimate the value.
        <br>

        <!--The participant who is most accurate at guessing the value of the work's of calligraphy will win $10.00.-->
