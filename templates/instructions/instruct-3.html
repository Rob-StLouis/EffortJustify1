           In this game, you have 60 seconds to try and earn as much money as possible.
           There are paintings of different value, between $100 and $500 dollars. By pressing the right
            button on your keyboard as fast as possible, you can get to the paintings faster and earn more.
            Some of the levels will be more or less difficult. Sometimes it will be very easy to move towards the painting,
            and sometimes you can press the button over and over and feel like you aren't going anywhere. However,
            it is always possible to reach the painting in each level.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you decide you want to skip a level and try the next next painting, you can press "S" and you will advance.
            There are always more levels, so you will never run out of paintings to get.
            However, there is no way to go back once you skip a painting.
