           In this game, you have 60 seconds to try and earn as much money as possible by collecting paintings. Each painting is worth between
            $100 and $500 dollars. Press the right
            button on your keyboard as fast as possible to get to the paintings. Each time you reach a painting you earn its value.
            The levels will vary in the their difficulty. Sometimes it will be very easy to move towards the painting,
            and sometimes you can press the button over and over and feel like you aren't going anywhere. However,
            it is always possible to reach the painting in each level.

            If you decide you want to skip a level and try the next painting, you can press "S" and you will advance.
            There are always more levels, so you will never run out of paintings. While you don't want to spend all your time
            skipping levels, there will be levels that are worth skipping.
            However, there is no way to go back once you skip a painting.
